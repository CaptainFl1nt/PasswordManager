# PasswordManager
Python Password Manager Program
This is a secure password manager implemented in Python. Save it somewhere on your computer with the asssociated diceware.txt file. Run in the terminal.

This depends on the PyCryptodome package. To install, type either "pip install pycryptodome" or "pip3 install pycryptodome".

It may be necessary to directly indicate the location of the data file. To do this, change the line of the program "manager = PasswordManager()" to include the path to the data file as an argument.
